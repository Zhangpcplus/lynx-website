# ReloadBundleEntry

_ReloadBundle_ refers to the reload rendering pipeline triggered by the native interface `LynxView.reloadTemplate` or the frontend framework interface [`lynx.reload`](/api/lynx-api/lynx/lynx-reload.html), which causes the rendering pipeline of the [TemplateBundle](/api/lynx-native-api/template-bundle) to be reloaded and executed. `ReloadBundleEntry` is used to record the performance data for the reload pipeline and inherits from [`PipelineEntry`](./pipeline-entry).

The main flowchart for the native interface `LynxView.reloadTemplate` and the frontend framework interface `lynx.reload` is shown below.

## Example

This example demonstrates how to obtain a `ReloadBundleEntry`.

import { Go } from '@lynx';

<Go
  example="performance-api"
  defaultFile="src/reload-bundle-entry/index.tsx"
  defaultEntryFile="dist/reload-bundle-entry.lynx.bundle"
  img="https://lf-lynx.tiktok-cdns.com/obj/lynx-artifacts-oss-sg/plugin/static/exmaple-reload-bundle-entry.jpeg"
  entry="src/reload-bundle-entry"
  highlight="{14-25}"
/>

## Instance properties

### [entryType](/api/lynx-api/performance-api/performance-entry#entryType)

```ts
entryType: string;
```

The type of the performance event; the value for all instances of this class is fixed as `pipeline`.

### [name](/api/lynx-api/performance-api/performance-entry#name)

```ts
name: string;
```

The specific names of the performance events; the value for events triggered by the native interface is fixed as `reloadBundleFromNative`; the value for events triggered by the frontend framework is fixed as `reloadBundleFromBts`.

```ts
identifier: string;
```
